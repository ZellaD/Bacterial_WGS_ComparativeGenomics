WGS and Comparative Genomics of 4 Potential Biocontrol Agents against Pierce's Disease of Grapevine

Xylella fastidiosa, the causal agent of Pierce's disease (PD) of grapevine (Vitis vinifera), is a xylem-limited bacterium for which effective management strategies are limited. Pseudomonas viridiflava and Achromobacter xylosoxidans are in high relative abundance in the endosphere of healthy grapevines and have previously been shown to be negatively correlated with X. fastidiosa titer and PD symptom severity. In this study, we evaluated these two native endophytic microbes, along with Parakburkholderia phytofirmans strain PsJN, an established biocontrol agent for PD, for their ability to mitigate X. fastidiosa in planta. We assessed their potential through in vitro analyses, visual disease ratings, pathogen titer, and biocontrol population sizes and spatial distribution. Our results indicated that the grapevine-associated P. viridiflava and A. xylosoxidans are potential biocontrol agents against X. fastidiosa and significantly suppress PD symptoms as they show comparable results to P. phytofirmans. This work is the first step toward assessing these endophytic microbesâ€™ ability to suppress PD, providing the foundation for future research to better understand plant-microbe-pathogen interactions and to develop integrated management strategies for this disease.
